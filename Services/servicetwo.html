                    <h1>Bugatti</h1>
                    <p>Automobiles Ettore Bugatti was a French car manufacturer of high-performance automobiles, 
                       founded in 1909 in the then-German city of Molsheim, 
                       Alsace by the Italian-born industrial designer Ettore Bugatti. 
                       The cars were known for their design beauty and for their many race victories. 
                       Famous Bugattis include the Type 35 Grand Prix cars, the Type 41 "Royale", 
                       the Type 57 "Atlantic" and the Type 55 sports car.
                       The death of Ettore Bugatti in 1947 proved to be the end for the marque, 
                       and the death of his son Jean Bugatti in 1939 ensured there was not a successor to lead the factory. 
                       No more than about 8,000 cars were made. 
                       The company struggled financially, and released one last model in the 1950s, 
                       before eventually being purchased for its airplane parts business in 1963.
                       In 1987, an Italian entrepreneur bought the brand and revived it as a builder
                       of limited production exclusive sports cars based in Modena. In 1998, 
                       the Volkswagen Group bought the rights to the Bugatti marque and set up a subsidiary based back in Molsheim, 
                       Alsace.

                        Bugattis are noticeably focused on design. 
                        Engine blocks were hand scraped to ensure that the surfaces were so flat that gaskets were not required for sealing, 
                        many of the exposed surfaces of the engine compartment featured guilloch√© (engine turned) finishes on them, 
                        and safety wires had been threaded through almost every fastener in intricately laced patterns. 
                        Rather than bolt the springs to the axles as most manufacturers did, 
                        Bugatti's axles were forged such that the spring passed through a carefully sized opening in the axle, 
                        a much more elegant solution requiring fewer parts. He famously described his arch competitor Bentley's 
                        cars as "the world's fastest lorries" for focusing on durability. According to Bugatti, "weight was the enemy".
